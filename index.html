        <p>This is the semester project for <strong>Rick Colgan</strong> in <strong>SWDV620: Web Applications</strong>. I am attempting to provide all of the requirements for this assignment within this framework. According to the     assignment's documentation, I must provide the following:</p>
        <p><strong>A diagram/wireframe of the web app showing all pages and interactions.</strong> The wireframe of this web app can be found by clicking on the Wireframe menu option above. I created a generic template so that pages could be copied and used repeatedly for this project. As such, the wireframe is simple and adequately lays out the interaction of all pages.</p>
		<p><strong>An application that functions in its implementation.</strong> I shall leave it to the user to determine if this application functions adequately for the player's purposes. I believe, however, that it does. It allows for all necessary inputs from the user, performs all calculations correctly, and informs the user of the requirements necessary for their next upgrade.</p>
		<p><strong>A written or recorded explanation of the application's purpose and attempted functionality as well as a description of how a user would interact with it.</strong> The purpose of the app is to allow a user to calculate the amount of resources necessary to upgrade their next building in the online game, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funplus.kingofavalon&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Kingdom of Avalon</a>. The user will enter the number of items they have of a given resource, the number of resources required to build it, and the computer will calculate the remaining amount of resources to gather/find/plunder.</p>
		<p><strong>Testing should be included in the files as well.</strong> Due to the nature of this app, I am uncertain how to show the testing unless I include seperate screenshots of the calculator functioning. I could write some code for Selenium or Katalon, but those are typically done with online apps and not locally-hosted ones.</p>
		<p><strong>Student notes:</strong> I believe this meets the requirements set forth in the assignment as this is something that will lead to an improvement in one of my own interests. It has also received instructor approval in the <a href="https://maryville.instructure.com/courses/32095/discussion_topics/459335" target="_blank">discussion boards</a> for this class. Documentation and comments have been placed into the food.html file since the other html files are similar.</p>
